Machine Learning & Data Science Workspace
Welcome to my Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science (DS) Code Workspace! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my work, explorations, and projects in the fields of ML and DS. Here, you’ll find a variety of resources, including Python scripts, notebooks, and datasets, all aimed at mastering essential concepts and techniques in these dynamic domains.

Repository Structure
📂 Data Preparation: Scripts and notebooks for data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering. This section covers essential steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.

📂 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed EDA scripts that help in understanding the underlying patterns, distributions, and relationships in the datasets. Includes visualizations and statistical summaries.

📂 Hypothesis Testing: Code related to hypothesis testing, including p-value calculations, ANOVA, chi-square tests, and other statistical methods that are fundamental to validating assumptions in data science.

📂 Machine Learning Models: Implementation of various ML algorithms, from linear regression to advanced ensemble methods like Random Forests and XGBoost. Each script includes model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

📂 Deep Learning: Notebooks covering neural networks, including multi-layer perceptrons, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). This section also includes model implementations using frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

📂 Projects: End-to-end projects that demonstrate the application of ML and DS concepts to solve real-world problems. Each project includes problem statements, data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

📂 Resources & Tutorials: A collection of tutorials and reference materials that provide additional insights into specific ML and DS topics. This includes both theoretical explanations and practical code examples.
